Nuss-Checker 
==============================================

A proof checker for the Nullstellensatz proof format. 


To compile use `./configure.sh` and then `make`.
Furthermore, you need to have installed `gmp` to run `Nuss-Checker`.

For further information we refer to the paper:

Daniela Kaufmann, Armin Biere. 
 [`Nullstellensatz-Proofs for Multiplier Verification.`](http://fmv.jku.at/papers/KaufmannBiere-CASC20.pdf)
In Proc. Computer Algebra in Scientific Computing, pages 368-389, IEEE 2019.

Usage: 
----------------------------------

nusschecker [ <option> ... ]  [ <polynomials> <cofactor>] [<spec>]

where <option> is one of the following

  -h | --help            print this command line option summary and exit

  -t | --no-target       only calculate final sum but not that proof generates target

  -v | --verbose         get verbose output on number of checked inferences (beep every 500 rules)

  -e | --use-exponents   turn off implicit reduction of exponents

  -a0                    addition in tree approach, depth first (default)
  -a1                    addition in tree approach, breadth first
  -a2                    addition in sequence
  -a3                    addition by sorting one single stack

  -s0                    sort variables according to  strcmp (default)
  -s1                    sort variables according to -1*strcmp 
  -s2                    sort variables according to input order
  -s3                    sort variables according to reverse input order

The <polynomials> argument should point to a file with the
original set of polynomials and <cofactor> is a path to a file
containing the co-factors of the Nullstellensatz proof.

The <spec> is optional. Ommiting this file has the same effect as choosing option '-t'
It should point to a file with a single polynomial which
should be generated by the proof.
